# rubyTextEditScript

This is a test script.  The file given was a file that was supposed to be delimited by pipes ( "|" ) and have no spaces throughout.  When entering the data in a new system there were things such as tabs, returns, and various spacing issues that were preventing the file from being used.  My task was to script / clean this file in a proficient manner.
